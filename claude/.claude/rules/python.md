- Use `uv` exclusively (never pip/poetry/pipenv); use `uvx` for PyPI tools
- When I ask you to write a self-contained script it must use PEP 723 inline dependencies:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.8"
# dependencies = ["requests>=2.28", "click>=8.0"]
# ///

import requests
import click
```

* Run self-contained scripts with: `uvx --script <file.py>`
* Use Black for formatting and Ruff for linting
* Use type hints for function signatures and prefer modern syntax for builtin types: don't import `List, Dict, ...` from `typing`, instead use, e.g., `list[float]`.
* Use pathlib for filesystem operations
