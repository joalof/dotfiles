### Summary of KMonad Permission Fixes

To get KMonad working after encountering "Permission denied" errors for both `/dev/uinput` and your physical keyboard (`/dev/input/by-id/...-event-kbd`), we needed to ensure your user had the necessary read/write permissions for both device types.

Here's a breakdown of the steps taken:

---

#### 1. Fixing `/dev/uinput` Permissions (for Virtual Device Creation)

* **Problem:** The `/dev/uinput` device, which KMonad uses to create the remapped keyboard, was not accessible by your user. This typically happened because the `uinput` group didn't own the device or didn't have the correct permissions.
* **Solution:**
    1.  **Created the `uinput` group** if it didn't exist:
        ```bash
        sudo groupadd uinput
        ```
    2.  **Added your user to the `uinput` group**:
        ```bash
        sudo usermod -aG uinput $USER
        ```
    3.  **Configured a `udev` rule** (`/etc/udev/rules.d/99-kmonad.rules`) to automatically set the `uinput` group as the owner of `/dev/uinput` with read/write permissions (mode `0660`) every time the device is created:
        ```
        KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0660", GROUP="uinput", OPTIONS+="static_node=uinput"
        ```

#### 2. Fixing Physical Keyboard Input Permissions (for Reading Raw Key Presses)

* **Problem:** KMonad also needed to read the raw input from your actual keyboard, which was similarly denied access.
* **Solution:**
    1.  **Added your user to the `input` group**:
        ```bash
        sudo usermod -aG input $USER
        ```
    2.  **Configured a `udev` rule** (`/etc/udev/rules.d/98-input-devices.rules`) to grant the `input` group read/write permissions (mode `0660`) to all input event devices (`/dev/input/event*`):
        ```
        KERNEL=="event*", SUBSYSTEM=="input", MODE="0660", GROUP="input"
        ```

#### Essential Final Steps

After implementing these changes (adding users to groups and creating `udev` rules), it was **crucial to reload `udev` rules and then reboot the system** for all permission changes to take full effect:

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
sudo reboot
